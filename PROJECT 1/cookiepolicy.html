            <h4 style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; text-align: center;">This Cookie Policy explains how GOAL ORIENTED ACADEMY uses cookies and similar tracking technologies across our website, mobile application, and related services. By accessing or using our services, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to the use of cookies as described in this policy. If you do not agree with the way we use cookies, you should adjust your browser settings or discontinue the use of our services. Your continued use of the platform signifies your acceptance of the practices outlined in this policy.
            Cookies are small data files placed on your device when you visit or interact with our services. They play an important role in enabling functionality, improving performance, enhancing security, and personalizing your experience. When you visit our website, cookies allow us to remember your preferences, maintain your session, understand how you interact with various features, and deliver content that is more relevant to your interests. Some cookies are essential for the basic operation of our services and allow functions such as logging in, navigating pages, or maintaining shopping cart items. Others help us analyze usage patterns, identify technical issues, and optimize the overall experience.
            We use cookies for several purposes, including recognizing repeat visitors, understanding how pages are accessed and navigated, measuring the effectiveness of content and marketing materials, and ensuring that our services load quickly and operate reliably. Certain cookies help us understand which features are most useful to users and which areas may require improvement. In addition, advertising cookies allow us to deliver more relevant ads by measuring how users engage with advertisements and by preventing repetitive or unwanted promotions. These advertising and analytics tools may involve collaboration with third-party service providers who use their own cookies or tracking technologies to gather information about user behavior across the Internet.
            Some of the information collected through cookies includes the type of device and browser you use, your IP address, your general geographic location, pages you visit, links you click, and how long you spend on various parts of the site. This information is typically anonymized and used to create aggregated reports that help us understand user behavior and platform performance. However, because cookies interact with your browser and device, they may also function in combination with other data you provide to help personalize your experience or maintain account accuracy.
            If you prefer not to use cookies, you have the ability to manage or disable them through the settings of your browser or device. Most browsers allow you to block cookies, delete existing cookies, or receive notifications before a cookie is stored. While the exact instructions vary depending on the browser, the general process involves accessing privacy or security settings and adjusting cookie permissions. It is important to understand that disabling cookies may result in reduced functionality, slower performance, or an inability to access certain features of our services. Some parts of the site may not function properly without essential cookies, and your overall user experience may be impacted.
            In cases where third-party cookies are used, we may partner with external providers such as analytics platforms, advertising networks, and social media services. These third parties may place cookies on your device to track online activities across various websites. Their data collection and usage practices are governed by their own privacy and cookie policies, which we encourage you to review to better understand how your information may be used outside of our services. While we take steps to ensure that third-party partners meet certain privacy standards, we do not control their technologies and are not responsible for their practices.
            We may modify this Cookie Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, technologies, legal requirements, or service features. When updates occur, we will revise the “Last Updated” date and may provide additional notice if significant changes are made. Your continued use of the services after any updates become effective indicates your acceptance of the revised policy. If you do not agree with any changes, you must stop using the services or adjust your cookie preferences accordingly.
            If you have questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Cookie Policy or the way cookies are used across our services, you may contact us at goa@gmail.com or by using any communication method provided on our website. We are committed to maintaining transparency and ensuring that you have clear, accessible information about how your data is collected and used as you interact with our services.</h4>
