            <h1 style="text-align: center; font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-size: 100px;">TERMS OF SERVICE</h1>
            <h4 style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; text-align: center;">These Terms of Service constitute a legally binding agreement between you and GOAL ORIENTED ACADEMY regarding your access to and use of our website, mobile application, and any related products, features, or services. By using or accessing our services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by these terms. If you do not agree with any part of these terms, you must discontinue use of the services immediately. Your continued use of the services represents your ongoing acceptance of all policies, guidelines, and conditions described here.
            You must understand that our services are provided for lawful purposes and may only be used in a manner consistent with all applicable laws, regulations, and community standards. You agree not to engage in any behavior that could harm the integrity, functionality, security, or reputation of the services or interfere with the experience of other users. This includes, but is not limited to, attempts to access unauthorized areas of the platform, upload malicious code, exploit vulnerabilities, misrepresent your identity, harvest data, or use the services in connection with illegal activities. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access if we determine that your actions or content violate these terms or pose a threat to our platform or users.
            By creating an account or submitting information through the services, you affirm that all information provided is accurate, current, and complete. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. If you suspect unauthorized access or believe your account security has been compromised, you agree to notify us promptly. We are not liable for any loss or damage that results from your failure to safeguard your account or comply with these responsibilities.
            Any content you submit to the services, including text, images, feedback, or other materials, must be your own or used with appropriate permission. By posting or transmitting content, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, display, modify, adapt, and distribute such content as needed to operate, improve, promote, or administer the services. You retain ownership of your content, but you acknowledge that we may remove or refuse to display any content that we determine is inappropriate, harmful, unlawful, or in violation of these terms. You also acknowledge that we are not responsible for monitoring user content or preventing all potentially harmful behavior, though we may take reasonable action to address violations.
            Our services may include proprietary materials, intellectual property, software, and branding that belong to [Your Company Name] or our partners. These assets are protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws. You agree not to copy, distribute, modify, reverse engineer, or create derivative works from any portion of the services unless you have obtained explicit written permission from us. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property may result in legal action and termination of your access to the services.
            We may provide links to third-party websites, platforms, or services for your convenience. These third-party resources are not under our control, and we are not responsible for their content, practices, or policies. Your use of such external sites is entirely at your own risk, and you should review the terms and privacy practices of any third-party service you choose to access. We do not endorse or guarantee the accuracy, reliability, or security of any third-party resources.
            Our services are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis, without warranties or guarantees of any kind. We do not promise that the services will be uninterrupted, error-free, secure, or available at all times. There may be times when maintenance, updates, technical issues, or external factors affect the performance or accessibility of the services. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all implied warranties, including those related to merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. You use the services at your own discretion and assume all risks associated with your activity and reliance on any information or functionality they provide.
            In no event shall GOAL ORIENTED ACADEMY, its employees, partners, affiliates, or agents be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or exemplary damages arising out of or related to your use of the services, including but not limited to data loss, service interruption, business interruption, or loss of profits. Certain jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of specific liabilities, so some limitations may not apply to you. Regardless of circumstance, our total liability to you will not exceed the amount you have paid to use the services, if any, during the twelve months preceding the event giving rise to the claim.
            You acknowledge that we may modify these Terms of Service at any time to reflect changes in our operations, legal requirements, or service offerings. Updates will take effect once they are posted, unless otherwise required by law. Your continued use of the services after changes become effective signifies your acceptance of the updated terms. If you do not agree to the revised terms, you must stop using the services immediately.
            We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your access to the services at our sole discretion, with or without notice, for any conduct that we believe violates these terms or threatens the security or stability of the platform. Upon termination, you must cease all use of the services, and any rights or licenses previously granted to you will end. However, termination does not affect any legal obligations or rights that arise from activities that occurred before the termination date.
            If any part of these Terms of Service is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, that portion will be interpreted in a manner consistent with applicable law to reflect the original intent, and the remainder of the terms will remain fully in effect. These terms represent the entire agreement between you and GOAL ORIENTED ACADEMY concerning your use of the services and supersede any previous agreements or understandings between the parties.
            If you have questions, concerns, or requests regarding these Terms of Service, you may contact us at goa@gmail.com or through any method provided on our website or application. We are committed to maintaining transparency, fairness, and clarity in all aspects of our service agreement.</h4>
