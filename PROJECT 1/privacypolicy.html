            <h1 style="text-align: center; font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-size: 100px;">PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
            <h4 style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; text-align: center;">This Privacy Policy explains how GOAL ORIENTED ACADEMY collects, uses, discloses, and protects information when you interact with our website, mobile application, or any related products and services. We are committed to respecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal data. By using our services, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy and agree to the practices described within it. If you do not agree with the terms in this policy, you should refrain from using our services.
            We may collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us, such as your name, email address, phone number, payment details, account credentials, or any other data you choose to submit. Additionally, certain information is collected automatically when you use our services, including device information, IP addresses, browser types, access times, pages viewed, referral pages, and general interaction behavior. We also utilize cookies, web beacons, pixels, and similar tracking technologies to personalize your experience, improve functionality, analyze trends, and understand user engagement. These technologies may collect information about your browsing patterns and usage habits. You can usually adjust your browser settings to limit or disable cookies, but doing so may affect functionality.
            We may receive information about you from third-party partners, including analytics providers, payment processors, advertising networks, and social media platforms. This information helps us operate, enhance, and personalize your experience across our services. We use the information we collect to provide and maintain our services, process transactions, offer customer support, communicate with you about updates and promotions, analyze performance and usage trends, enforce our policies, detect and prevent fraud, and comply with legal obligations. Your information may also be used to send newsletters, marketing communications, or promotional offers, although you may opt out of such communications at any time.
            We protect your information through administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to reduce the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, or disclosure. These protections include encryption, secure servers, access controls, and periodic security reviews. However, no method of transmission or storage can ever be completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute protection. You understand that <strong>sharing information online always carries some level of risk.</strong> 
            We may share your information with third-party service providers that help us operate our services, such as hosting providers, payment processors, analytics services, advertising partners, and customer support platforms. These parties are permitted to access your information only to perform tasks on our behalf and are obligated to protect it. In the event of a business transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, asset sale, restructuring, or bankruptcy, your information may be transferred as part of the associated assets. We may also disclose information when required to comply with laws, legal processes, or government requests, or when necessary to protect our rights, safety, or the rights and safety of others. We will only share information for additional purposes if you have given your explicit consent.
            We retain personal information for as long as it is needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy, unless a longer retention period is required by law. Once information is no longer necessary, we will securely delete, anonymize, or store it in an archived form. You may have rights under applicable privacy laws, including the ability to access, correct, delete, or restrict the use of your information, as well as the ability to withdraw consent or object to processing. You may also have the right to request copies of your information or to file a complaint with a regulatory authority. To exercise these rights, you may contact us at any time, and we will respond within the timeframe required by law.
            Our services are not intended for children under the age required by local law, typically 13 years old, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we learn that we have collected such information without proper consent, we will promptly delete it. Our services may also contain links to external websites or platforms that are not operated by us. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of those third-party sites, and we encourage you to review their privacy policies separately.
            Because our services may operate globally, your information may be transferred to and processed in countries other than your own. These countries may have different data protection laws. We take steps to ensure that any cross-border transfer complies with applicable legal requirements and includes adequate protections, such as contractual safeguards or other approved mechanisms.
            We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in our practices, technologies, or legal requirements. When modifications are made, we will revise the “Last Updated” date and may provide notice through our website or direct communication if the changes are significant. Continued use of our services after the updated policy takes effect constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.
            If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy or the handling of your personal information, you may contact us at goa@gmail.com or at GOAL ORIENTED ACADEMY. We are committed to addressing your inquiries and ensuring transparency in how we manage your information.</h4>
