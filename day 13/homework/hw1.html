        <h3>How does Motorcycle generally work?</h3>

        <p>Motorcycles are two-wheeled motor vehicles designed for a wide range of purposes, including commuting, sport, touring, and off-road riding. They are powered by internal combustion engines—typically ranging from 50cc to over 1,000cc—or by electric motors in modern models.</p>

        <p>Motorcycles come in various types, such as cruisers, known for comfort and style; sport bikes, built for speed and agility; touring bikes, designed for long-distance travel with added storage and comfort; off-road or dirt bikes, made for rugged terrain; and dual-sport bikes, which can handle both street and trail riding.</p>

        <p>Riding a motorcycle requires balance, coordination, and protective gear like helmets, jackets, gloves, and boots for safety. They are popular for their fuel efficiency, maneuverability, and sense of freedom. However, they also pose higher risks in accidents compared to cars, making rider training and awareness essential.</p>

        <p>Modern motorcycles often include advanced features such as ABS (anti-lock braking systems), traction control, smart displays, and even connectivity to smartphones for navigation and performance monitoring.</p>

        <p>In short, motorcycles combine practicality, performance, and enjoyment, appealing to riders who value both mobility and adventure.</p>
